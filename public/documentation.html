  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>This project is a RESTful API serving a request back to the user via the server and business logic. The main
    purpose of the API is to support a database for animated films, once connected to a client and server. This API
    contains the necessary logic to ensure the data is transferred. Right now the data is hardcoded for testing
    purposes.</p>
